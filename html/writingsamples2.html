                        The increasing dependence on servers for businesses comes with enormous underlying costs that virtualization can minimize. The total cost of ownership (TCO) for an average server is $2,333/year for the first four years and $2,844/year onwards due to increasing maintenance costs, according to an Xpertechs report.<br><br>

                        Virtualization involves the process of simulating servers in a virtual environment. This allows for much fewer physical servers to accomplish the same tasks at a realistic average consolidation ratio of 6.3:1. Servers with low usage can be ideal candidates to store and run these virtualized environments as their energy and maintenance costs arenâ€™t optimized for the work load they perform. This would decrease the amount of physical hardware maintenance and energy costs with little to no performance loss as every virtualized server would be a file which can be copied and deployed many times over.<br><br>

                        The roll back feature of virtualization allows for a whole new aspect of development and testing. New products which previously may have required multiple machines to test on can be developed using a virtualized environment on a single machine. This machine can then be rolled back and reused indefinitely for multiple projects or can be repurposed for business use or training. Training done on these machines would have no effect on the server as every virtualized environment is isolated allowing for mistakes to be done without serious consequences.<br><br>

                        Business capabilities of a virtualized environment extends to customer support as well. When a customer calls in for help a support staff may need to use a machine with a similar environment, be that windows 10, Vista, XP, etc. Previously, this would have required a reboot in order to load the proper operating system and application in order to guide customers to resolve their issue. With virtualization, multiple environments can be launched simultaneously on one machine without the need to reboot.<br>
