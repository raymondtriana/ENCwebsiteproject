            <p class ="dropcap"> While I was born in Sarasota, Florida, some people find it surprising that I have never visited any other state. My father, Gordon Adams, was also born and raised here. He passed away from brain cancer when I was 14 years old, but his love of the beaches and sunny skies lives on in me. Because my mother became disabled shortly after his passing, I became independent at a young age. Yet, the obstacles I faced never stopped me from following my dreams and becoming a technical communicator. In fact, they just fueled my passion to succeed. In Summer 2012, I graduate from the University of Central Florida. As an English-Technical Communications major, I have been able to lend my love for the written word to others in the community. I chose to be a technical communicator because I want to write documents that help people in their daily lives. Through technical writing, I can give back to others, including those that supported me during my journey. I am a people person, and knowing that I can make a difference, big or small, is what truly matters to me.
            </p>
            <p> My desire to make a difference is also why I am active on campus and enjoy leadership opportunities. As Vice President of Future Technical Communicators, a student member of the Society for Technical Communication, and a member of the Burnett Honors College, I am able to make a difference in the community while serving as a role model for others. My participation in the Honors in the Major program has allowed me to take graduate level courses and <img src ="Brit.jpg" height ="214" width ="300" border ="0" class ="image_right" alt ="Brit"/> and write an undergraduate thesis that will be published when I graduate. My research topic is "Social Media and its Effect on Privacy". I am also a member of Sigma Tau Delta, the International English Honors Society.
            </p>
            <p> In addition to writing, my passions include singing and animals. I began singing as a child and continue to practice it as an adult. Singing has always been one of my greatest talents and outlets. In regards to my other passion, animals, I have always loved a wide variety of species. Recently, I overcame my fear of reptiles. <img src ="snake.jpg" height ="224" width ="300" border = "0" class ="image_left" alt ="Snake"/> I believe that no animal should be feared; rather, they should be respected.
            </p>
            <p> Although this short biography is only a snippet of my life, the most significant thing that people can learn about me is that I live life with no regrets. I believe that everything happens for a reason and I take advantage of all life has to give. I am an optimistic and understanding individual. I look forward to life after graduation, and know that with dedication and a positive outlook on life, I can always achieve my goals.
