                        Hello Group 2,<br>
               
                        With the prospects of building our own Web site on the horizon I found the example of Baudelaire’s flâneur to be the most interesting. The flâneur is described as a man who aimlessly wonders about in big crowds taking in the world around him through observation yet remaining hidden to everybody. Applen’s description of the flâneur as a man who “finds pleasure and fulfillment moving through a Parisian street, connecting with people for a nanosecond, then moving on…” (Applen, 10) allowed me to make a connection between it and the modularity of the Web.<br>

                        Throughout the new media and literacy section of the book, HTML and the Web was repeatedly described as composing of dynamic and changeable modular units of data. Each Web page is not only independent of another, save for the occasional URL links, but also composed of modular objects such as videos and images. Each object is essentially a visiting flâneur within the streets of its HTML file who “can be used, but not modified, to construct the whole of a Web site.” (Applen, 8) These objects, be they imported CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc. may interact with each other occasionally but are never bound to one file.<br>

                        Whenever somebody writes code the aim is always to write it to perform a task as efficiently as possible. However, we shouldn’t overlook the need to decouple our creations from each other as much as possible. A well-designed Web site doesn’t just look good or run well it must also be built well. Creating modularity wherever possible allows us to reuse instead of reinvent data and creates an environment where removing an image, tag, or variable doesn’t lead to the collapse of a Webpage. Instead, a module could be replaced or even updated to better our designs.<br>
